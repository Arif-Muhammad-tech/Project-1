		<p>Spain was hit by fateful heat waves and broke temperature records; in August, Córdoba reached 47.4ºC, the highest ever recorded in the country, an alarming scenario considering that more than 74% of the territory is at risk of desertification; the level of the dams is well below the average for this time of year and the Tagus river basin had, in mid-September, a stored water value of 33.5%. The hydrological year ended on September 30th and Spain did not meet the annual flows in the Tagus and Douro rivers. </p>
			

			<p>To alleviate decades-old problems, at the end of September the Government of Pedro Sánchez gave the green light to the new plan for the Tagus basin, which foresees a 40% cut in the volume of water that is diverted through the Tagus-Segura transfer, to irrigate the regions from Almería, Murcia and Alicante. The plan, which will be approved at the end of October or beginning of November, will benefit weakened reservoirs at the head of the Tagus with an additional 105 cubic hectometers of water from 2027, and Portugal, by drag, will have a greater flow of water entering the country . The objective is to improve ecological flows in the Tagus River and avoid failure in the quotas of the Albufeira Convention, as is currently happening. In Portugal, this was the second year with less rain since 1931; In the Tagus basin, the harshness of the Sun dried up dozens of streams or reduced them to ponds, leaving the rivers increasingly sluggish and the land thirsty.</p>

			 </p>On September 19, the reservoirs were at 46.8% of their capacity, a situation that remained unchanged despite the high levels of precipitation caused by storm Danielle. According to the PDSI (index that measures the drought situation), Portugal now has 50.2% of the territory in moderate drought and 45.9% in severe drought. Water stress continues, as does the dependence on water flowing from Spain. And here comes the Tagus, which crosses borders and feeds two countries. During the scorching month of August, the Express traveled the 1,092 kilometers of the river, from its source to its mouth. What he found was misery: sometimes open sewers, other times beds of dry rocks, the indisputable beauty of the Tagus risks disappearing if nothing is done to combat the moribund state of these waters.. </p>
